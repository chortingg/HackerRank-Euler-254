Project Euler Problem 254 (partially-solved):
Sum of Digit Factorials

This is my Naive solution: this is the most "obvious", brute-force method to implement a solution, and when n is increased to around >46, we will have to wait longer than the heat death of the universe for the result to come out.

Currently working to improve on it.
